# On-Time-Delivery-Prediction

### Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict whether an order will be delivered on time based on customer, product, and shipment-related features. The model is built using a Random Forest Classifier and involves preprocessing data, handling class imbalance, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.

### Dataset

This data includes the following features:

- Customer_care_calls: Number of calls made by the customer to customer care.
- Customer_rating: Customer's satisfaction rating (1â€“5).
- Cost_of_the_Product: Cost of the purchased product.
- Prior_purchases: Number of purchases made by the customer before this order.
- Gender: Customer's gender (encoded as 0 = Female, 1 = Male).
- Discount_offered: Discount applied to the product.
- Weight_in_gms: Weight of the product in grams.
- Mode_of_Shipment: Shipment method (e.g., Ship, Flight).
- Warehouse_block: Block in the warehouse where the product was stored.
- Product_importance: Importance level of the product (e.g., Low, Medium, High).

##### Target Variable
- Reached.on.Time_Y.N: Binary variable indicating if the delivery was on time (1 = Yes, 0 = No).

### Workflow

##### Data Preprocessing:
- Handled missing values and scaled numerical features.
- One-hot encoded categorical variables like Mode_of_Shipment, Warehouse_block, and Product_importance.

##### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Visualized feature distributions and correlations with the target variable (Reached.on.Time_Y.N).

##### Feature Engineering:
- Created meaningful features from categorical and numerical variables to enhance model performance.

##### Machine Learning Model:
- Trained a Random Forest Classifier to predict the likelihood of a delivery arriving on time.

##### Real-Time Predictions:
- Provides real-time predictions for new orders using the trained model.

### Results

- Accuracy: 66%
- Precision (Class 1): 79%
- Recall (Class 1): 59%
- F1-Score (Class 1): 68%
- ROC-AUC: 0.74
